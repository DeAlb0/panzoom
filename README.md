# panzoom

panzoom consists of a javascript and a css file to include in .html pages to enable viewing embedded images in the full window
and use pan and zoom operations without the need to change the sources of e.g. sphinx generated .html pages.

It is specifically developed to work in .html files generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
with .png and .svg files included through the figure or plantuml directive.

It may work or be adaptable for other uses cases.

Set up
------

- if you are using sphinx change conf.py in your sources to get the panzoom functionality on all generated pages :
  - add the following line to the html_js_files = [ ... ] array (or add this array in case it does not exist)
    ```
       'https://dealb0.github.io/panzoom/code/panzoom.v1.x.js',
    ```    
  - add the following line to the html_css_files = [ ... ] array (or add this array in case it does not exist)
    ```  
       'https://dealb0.github.io/panzoom/code/panzoom.v1.x.css',
    ```    
  - of course you need to rebuild after adding these lines, but that's all you have to do

User's Guide
------------

The user of panzoom can do the following operations on suitable images (see below what suitable means) :

- mouse operations
  - click on the image to enlarge into the full window (with a small border, configurable with CSS)
  - use mouse wheel to enlarge the image or make it smaller = zoom in or out
  - use drag = click, hold and move with the 1st (usually left) mouse button to move around the image
  - click in the full window image to leave full window mode
- keyboard operation
  - press 'enter' on the image with focus to enter full window mode
    - please note that it is unfortunately not so easy to gain keyboard focus for an image, you have to press Tab a lot of times
    - if possible, you probably easier start here with the mouse and use the keyboard after that
  - use the arrow keys left, right, up, down to move the image as if you where changing your view direction
    - this practically means the image will move down when you press the up key, go left, when you press the key to the right
    - this sounds strange but feels more naturally like telling in which direction you would move your head
  - use the '+' and '-' key to enlarge or make it smaller = zoom in and out
  - press '*' or 'x' on the numeric keypad to return to default size and position
  - press '/' or '&divide;' on the numeric keypad to see the image in real size, even if that is too big for the window and requires panning to see everything
  - use the enter key to leave full window mode

Where does it work
------------------

panzoom is programmed to work on images that :
- have a minimum width of half of the parent width. The parent width is typically the width of the column
  - this is to avoid the annoying option to zoom small icons
  - please note that this depends on the width of the window. So smaller images may only be supported after making the window smaller 
- are injected with these Sphinx directives:
  - figure
  - drawio-figure
  - uml
  - needuml
- have the SVG or PNG format
  - SVGs are embedded into the html to allow using click events for both, hyperlinks and panning

As the panzoom does not interfere with the generation of the html code it has to find a way to work with the html code as it is.
This requires to have a parent element that contains only this image, so that the parent element is enlarged to full window
and the image is moved and zoomed inside the parent element.
